# autogen-research

## Overview

`autogen-research` is an open-source project aimed at extending the capabilities of [Autogen](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/autogen/overview/), a platform developed by Microsoft Research. This project specifically focuses on enhancing Autogen's prebuilt skills for searching academic publications. Initially inspired by a python script for searching [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/) for research papers, `autogen-research` aims to broaden its horizon by incorporating more publications and databases, making academic research more accessible and efficient.

## Goal

Create a comprehensive tool that serves as a one-stop solution for academic research, leveraging the power of Autogen.

## Skills

- **Search Core API**: CORE indexes research papers from data providers including institutional and subject repositories, preprint servers, and open access and hybrid journals. As of February 16, 2024, CORE contains 266M open access articles collected from 11K data providers around the world.
